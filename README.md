# About

Personal use command-line tool for measuring execution time of programs, just like linux 'time'(many windows time alternative implementations out there). Not suitable for benchmarking quick execution code because the creation, termination and scheduler stuff take most of the time, i believe. Alternatively, for better precision modify this code to wrap yours and time it on the fly skipping creation/termination.
